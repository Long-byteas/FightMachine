 # Game Description 
 
 1/ What is the main action in the game? <br />
 
 The main action in the game is You are in a starship trying to survive the enemies as long as possible. The enemies will constantly shooting at you and the longer you survive the higher the score is. You can shoot the enemies for some extra point but remember, the enemies is moving faster and stronger over time. <br />
 
 2/ What was the hardest part of the game to get working in Unreal? 
 Unreal is very hard to get started with. For me the hardest part of the game is acctually about the audio of the game. At first though I think mp3 is fine but it turns out I need to use .wav file. Then when I implement a slider in settings so that player can control the sound, it turns out to be very difficult because transferring a a value from a slider to a sound contain in the map is broken because the slider is remove ( i use removefromparent )
